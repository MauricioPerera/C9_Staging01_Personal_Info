I need replicate the user info form structure based on the Figma design using **React**.

# Background

I'm not frequently use React or Github by this i try to learn in the practice how its the correct mode to make this. As a extra i like get an extra points in my english witing experience

## Current learnings

- I can refer [**the documentation of React Native**](https://reactnative.dev/docs/components-and-apis) to see **native components** and not use an html elements
- I can refer [**the documentation of React Native**](https://reactnative.dev/docs/components-and-apis) to see examples of use **native components** and his attributes
- I need to get used to **using component attributes**
- I need remember **update the dependencies in the repo** when i edit this

## Next steps

- [ ] Check when it comes to phones or similar and includ the logic for formatting and validation
- [ ] In the case of Gender or similar data (data whit a limited number of possible values), use a radiobutton or a select instead of a text field
- [ ] Validate with the team how the information will be received to emulate it (currently i use a fixed string and need use a variable array or similar)
- [ ] I need validate how is the correct format to sent an update of information to the DB (currently i'm not make any whith this)
- [ ] If there is time left, validate the existing information in value vs. the updated information so that if they are the same, no update requests are made.
